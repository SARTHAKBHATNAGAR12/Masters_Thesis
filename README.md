## Title for the Project
A comprehensive evaluation of stacked autoencoders for text embedding.

## Abstract
In this research paper, we examine the effect of a stacked autoencoder architecture on text embedding by employing Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) models. The stacked autoencoder architecture can capture complex patterns and parameters within the dataset due to multiple layers and Bidirectional LSTMs and Bidirectional GRUs, known for their capability to capture context from both past and future sequences, are used as components to study autoencoder architectures. By leveraging the strengths of both, we will show that there is indeed a trade-off between model complexity and accuracy using layered architecture. Our results showcased that a three-layered bidirectional GRU autoencoder has the best accuracy. Moreover, the higher number of layers has a negligible impact on the accuracy, while potentially taking more computing resources.

## Introduction
Traditional machine learning approaches are a broad term covering various methods and algorithms to make predictions. Although machine learning seems complex, these stringent techniques require human intervention and domain expertise. To overcome the problems associated with machine learning, the concept of deep learning is introduced, which promises excellent flexibility and power by learning the hierarchy concepts, which can be further defined to achieve more straightforward tasks with more accuracy and less human intervention. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that comes under the unsupervised learning category and works on multi-layer structures. The multi-layer structures have several benefits over single layers as they can comprehend complex and non-linear relationships of the input data. Moreover, the multi-layers networks generalize the data effectively and utilize their ability to extract abstract features even from small datasets (Li, Pei and Li, 2023). Each layer in a structure performs low-level to high-level feature extraction, calling it a feature selection process. Among the myriad of deep learning techniques, autoencoders (Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams, 1985) have played a crucial role in feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and data representation. A detailed introduction to autoencoders is given by (Bourlard and Kamp, 1988). It is a specific type of neural network that promises the potential to convert raw data into compact and meaningful representations. As a result, they can aid in the understanding and manipulation of complex data. Autoencoders belong to a category of unsupervised machine-learning models that aim to learn compressed versions of representations of input data by transforming it into a latent space with reduced dimensions. The principal architecture of autoencoders involves two key components: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder's job is to compress and encode the input data, also known as the encoding phase. As the name suggests, it transforms or maps the input data with low-dimensional latent space or extracts meaningful features from input data. The purpose of the decoder is to reconstruct the original input data from the encoded representations, and it is known as the decoding phase. This process of encoding and decoding techniques in the model facilitates the acquisition of salient characteristics present in the input data which is why autoencoders is a valuable model architecture in deep learning for various tasks like dimensionality reduction and feature extraction.


One of the remarkable aspects of autoencoders is their ability to learn efficient data representations without requiring explicit labelling. These characteristics have gained significant attention in the big data era. By utilizing the potential of deep neural networks, autoencoders can uncover hidden patterns and relationships within the data, which can be the basis of improved decision-making in domain-specific tasks such as sentiment analysis and anomaly detection. Autoencoders have been employed not just for the purpose of reducing dimensionality and representing data, but they have also gained popularity as generative models. Variational Autoencoders (Pinheiro Cinelli et al., 2021) and Generative Adversarial Networks (Goodfellow et al., 2014) are the techniques that work on the principle of autoencoder architectures and elevate the power and creativity of AI to a new level. These generative models have been employed in many domain specific platforms such as image synthesis, drug discovery, etc. due to their ability to learn and acquire knowledge from the underlying probability distribution of data. The primary objective of this thesis is to examine the multifaceted domain of deep learning, with a specific focus on autoencoders. The exploration commences with an examination of the theoretical concepts and basic frameworks of autoencoders, in order to establish a robust groundwork for our subsequent inquiry. We undertake a critical experiment on the stack-layered architecture of autoencoders utilizing Bidirectional-LSTMs and Bidirectional-GRUs. The multiple hidden layers in autoencoders allow us to grasp the complex features of the input data and contribute to improving the outcomes (Bengio, 2009). However, some challenges are encountered due to multiple hidden layers while training the data, increasing training time and model complexity. This experimental study aims to examine the effect of the stack-layered architecture of autoencoder in text embedding using the Bidirectional LSTMs and Bidirectional GRUs as a combination.

Following that, set the base for suitable methodology. Then Section 4 discusses design requirements and specifications, and Section 5 discusses how the model was implemented. Subsequently, the Result and evaluation obtained related to the model are covered, and in the end, the Conclusion and suggestions for future work is given.

## Research Methodology
The section research methodology is a systematic and structured approach used in the experiment of hierarchical text embedding using stack-layered autoencoders. The selection of the most suitable data mining approach is a crucial part of crafting a model to generate precise and accurate results. With the careful examination of various data mining techniques, we have selected the KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) approach, which starts with data collection, preparation, and preprocessing, generating meaningful insights from the massive corpora, and model development. The rationale judgement behind selecting this approach for this study is derived from its comprehensive framework, which allows a detailed explanation of each component.

## Installation
Utilizing the advantages of readily accessible library modules, Python programming language is employed for the completion of this task, specifically version 3.6.9. Both the local workstation and Google web services are used for the execution of tasks. The local workstation with the hardware configuration of 64-bit Windows 11 OS, 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-11300H @ 3.10GHz Processor and 16GB of RAM was initially used. The first model training was done on the local workstation, but as we started training the model, it required massive amount of training time. Because of this, we switched to Google Clab Pro services. The Google Colab Platform is based on IaaS, which utilizes the Google Compute engine for computing operations. It offers a platform to write and execute code collaboratively and has a Jupyter Notebook interface specially designed for tasks like data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning. The High-end CPU, 25GB of RAM, and 100 computing units were configured to execute the task.
