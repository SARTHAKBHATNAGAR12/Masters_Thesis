## Title for the Project
A comprehensive evaluation of stacked autoencoders for text embedding.

## Abstract
In this research paper, we examine the effect of a stacked autoencoder architecture on text embedding by employing Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) models. The stacked autoencoder architecture can capture complex patterns and parameters within the dataset due to multiple layers and Bidirectional LSTMs and Bidirectional GRUs, known for their capability to capture context from both past and future sequences, are used as components to study autoencoder architectures. By leveraging the strengths of both, we will show that there is indeed a trade-off between model complexity and accuracy using layered architecture. Our results showcased that a three-layered bidirectional GRU autoencoder has the best accuracy. Moreover, the higher number of layers has a negligible impact on the accuracy, while potentially taking more computing resources.
